Project name: Digital filter, low pass 1khzÂ signal

Aim: To study the conversion of an analog signal to digital, the removal of unwanted signals (filtering), and the conversion of the filtered signal back to analog. 

Flow Char:
1. Start the process by initializing the necessary components.
2. Convert the analog signal to a digital one using an ADC.
3. Filter the digital signal to remove unwanted noise (using tiva board).
4. Convert the filtered digital signal back to analog using a DAC.
5. Output the filtered analog signal.
